# Assigment 2 Pokemon Object Hierarchy
## Due October, 10th

### Build an Object Oriented Pokemon Class Hierarchy

Okay, I may have gone a little overboard on how I wanted this to work. Because of that I've done part of the coding 
myself to give you something to start from. This will be a good experience for you to try to read someone else's code and
understand what it is doing.

Your task is to complete an Object Oriented Pokemon design for the Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise and the Charmander, Charmaleon, 
Charizard Pokemon species families. This is described by the UML diagram below. The UML image file is also in the 
repository as PokemonUMLDiagram.png

I have implemented everything in blue in the UML diagram. *Instructions continue below image*

What is included in this repository:
 * Pokemon.java abstract superclass for all Pokemon species
  * This is basically an extension of your first assignment Pokemon with some extra data fields and some abstract methods required of the subclasses.
  
 * Bulbasaur.java - Highest level subclass in the Grass|Poison dual-type Bulbasaur family
 * Ivysaur.java - Middle level subclass in the Bulbasaur family
 * Venusaur.java - Bottom level subclass in the Bulbasaur family
 
 * Interfaces (representing Pokemon types): These only implement constants that hold two descriptors, color and type as a String and arrays that hold allowed fast and special attacks and their respective power values.
   * FireType.java
   * FlyingType.java
   * GrassType.java
   * PoisonType.java
   * WaterType.java

 * TypeAttackEffectivenessChart.jpg - This shows the strength/weakness multipliers for different types. It should be used in your implementation of PerformFastAttack and PerformSpecialAttack methods.
 * PokemonAttackPower.xlsx and .ods - Spreadsheet of fast and special attack names, types, powers. These are already in the required interfaces, but you'll need them to do the extra credit projects.
 * PokemonHierarchy.gpj - This is the jGrasp project file. I have made a jGRASP project of this folder so it will generate the documentation and UML diagrams for you. When you open jGRASP go to the top menu item Project -> open and point it to the .gpj file. You will then see the Open Projects window and be able to see UML.
  * PokemonHierarchy_doc folder. This contains the documentation generated by my Javadoc comments in the .java files. If you double-click index.html that documentation should open in your webbrowser.
